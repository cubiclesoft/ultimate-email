<p>Once upon a time, there was this crazy guy named Thomas.<br />
And he ran a crazy company called CubicleSoft.</p>

<p>He wrote a library that did e-mail that actually worked.<br />
In PHP.</p>

<p>It was awesome.<br />
Eventually people decided it was so awesome, they parted with some money.</p>

<p>Don't forget to donate.</p>
