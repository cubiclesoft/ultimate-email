It was a dark and stormy night.<br />
Dark was cold and brooding.<br />
Stormy was kind and sensitive.<br />
They were the best of friends.<br />
<br />
One evening, they went and grabbed a chicken dinner...<br />
<br />
What's that you say?<br />
Well, they do happen to be real people.<br />
What else were you expecting?<br />
A boring clich√©?<br />
