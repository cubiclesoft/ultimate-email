Once upon a time, there was this crazy guy named Thomas.<br />
And he ran a crazy company called CubicleSoft.<br />
<br />
He wrote a library that did e-mail that actually worked.<br />
In PHP.<br />
<br />
It was awesome.<br />
Eventually people decided it was so awesome, they parted with some money.<br />
<br />
