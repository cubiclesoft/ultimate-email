Ultimate E-mail Toolkit
=======================

A PHP library of functions designed to handle all of your one-off e-mail needs under a MIT or LGPL license.  Instead of relying on the PHP mail() function, this library directly talks to SMTP and POP3 servers just as a regular e-mail client would.  The result is a high level of reliability in delivery of e-mail messages to recipients.  Functions like ConvertHTMLToText() and MakeValidEmailAddress() make it easy to do complex tasks such as convert ugly HTML input into beautiful plain-text output and analyze an e-mail address to automatically correct common mistakes.  All of that while following the various RFCs surrounding e-mail.

Features
--------

* Carefully follows the many IETF RFC Standards surrounding e-mail.
* Relatively complete and comprehensive, yet easy-to-use SMTP and POP3 libraries.  Fully MIME and Unicode-aware.

* Has a liberal open source license.  MIT or LGPL, your choice.

* Sits on GitHub for all of that pull request and issue tracker goodness to easily submit changes and ideas respectively.
